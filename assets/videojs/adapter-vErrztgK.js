* request generation). None of them raise the load gate: by the time this behavior runs the gate is already down —
* deliberately, since the appends that follow are what fire `encrypted` for the event-driven path — and browsers queue
* decode on missing keys, so an unlicensed source stalls rather than failing. Post-license, each session's
* `keystatuschange` is observed report-only: a key transitioning to expired / output-restricted / internal-error
* reports 4003 / 4007 / 4014, turning the HDCP and expiry silent-stall shapes diagnosable. Exclusion or renewal policy
* on those transitions stays downstream.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor, like `setupMediaKeys`. The session machinery lives in `media/dom/license-sessions.ts`
* — `openLicenseSession` drives one session for its lifetime, `listenForEncryptedInitData` is the fallback — bound to
* one `AbortController` per entry, so this behavior only decides which sessions to open and its state-exit cleanup is
* the abort. **Compose it ahead of `setupMediaKeys`**: `createComposition` calls cleanups in registration order, and
* the sessions opened here must be closed before `setupMediaKeys` detaches the MediaKeys they belong to. Setup order
* costs nothing in return — the precondition is reactive on `context.mediaKeys`, so this behavior parks until the
* negotiation it consumes has published.
*
* Writes no slots — it only reads the handoff and talks to the CDM and the license server. Rotation scope (tracked in
* drm-support.md): the manifest loop licenses every key declared at entry, so VOD key rotation (all keys present at
* load) is covered, and FairPlay rotation rides the `encrypted` fallback as segments append. The one gap is mid-stream
* rotation for Widevine / PlayReady on a live reload — the entry captures the presentation once, later reloads' keys
* are never re-scanned, and the `encrypted` fallback isn't armed for manifest-licensed content.

/**
* Keep the playhead in the live window, via a two-state reactor gated on the preconditions for "we know where live is":
*
* - **`inactive`** — no media element, or no live edge (`getLiveEdge` is `null`: VOD, ended, or unresolved). Idle.
* - **`live`** — preconditions met. `entry` commands `state.startPosition` once to the target live latency behind the
*   edge (clamped to the window start) so playback begins near the edge and the loader dispatches an in-window range;
*   `effects` runs the window-exit guard.
*
* A derivable live edge is itself the establishment gate: segment placement is settled at parse time — the reference
* track's local placement _is_ the presentation timeline, and every other track's first parse is held until the anchor
* is stamped (`resolve-track`'s gate + `establishStartMediaTime`) — so any window derived from resolved segments is
* already final, with no separate anchor signal to wait on (see
* `internal/design/spf/live-presentation-timeline-model.md`).
*
* The two pieces split along the axis a future DVR / EVENT mode will care about: the **one-time start position**
* (`entry`) is the _live-specific_ behavior — start near the edge on load; a DVR mode makes it conditional (start in
* place). The **window-exit guard** (`effects`) is the _general windowed-live_ behavior — applies to sliding-window
* live, DVR, and EVENT alike. Because the command is an `entry`, it fires once per entry into `live`; a source change
* exits to `inactive`, so the next source re-commands (no closure latch to reset). The guard stays a direct seek — it
* is recurring, while `startPosition` is a self-clearing one-shot.
*
* Window-exit guard: while playing (not paused), reposition to the live edge when the playhead has fallen behind the
* window start — including when a seek to a now-evicted position has stranded the playhead (such a seek can never
* settle, so we rescue rather than wait on it). Two triggers: the **window-update re-fire** (the guard reads the live
* edge, so each reload / slide re-runs it — this catches a stall, where `timeupdate` stops but the playlist keeps
* reloading) and a **`play` listener** for immediate reactivity on resume, since the reload interval can be seconds.
* `play`, not `playing`: after a long pause the playhead sits behind the window at an unseekable position, where the
* browser stalls and `playing` never fires; `play` fires on the paused→false transition regardless, so we snap before
* the stall. In-window pause / DVR scrub-back are left untouched.
*
* The latency comes from the injected `resolveLiveLatency` seam (HLS: `HOLD-BACK`), so this behavior carries no
* delivery-format specifics. `applyStartPosition` performs the seek, gated on `loadedmetadata` — which implies an open
* MediaSource and hence a declared seekable range (a seek outside `seekable` is clamped) — so this behavior needs no
* MediaSource precondition of its own.

* blinks mid-source — the edge can't, because `liveWindowForType` falls back to any resolved track of the type — so
* `entry` fires once per source without a latch, and a live reload (same source, slid window) correctly doesn't
* re-command.
*
* The flip side: the presentation _url_ is not part of this state, so replacing one already-resolved live presentation
* with another would stay in `live` and never command a start position for the new source. Unreachable today — every
* writer sets `{ url }` (unresolved) or `undefined` first, so a source change always transits `inactive`. Supporting a

/**
* **Serve an AirPlay receiver's FairPlay key requests.** During an AirPlay session WebKit takes playback off MSE and
* onto the native-HLS fallback `<source>` `setupAirPlay` appends, and the receiver raises its own key requests through
* the sender's CDM as `skd`. The MediaKeys `setupMediaKeys` negotiated are configured for `sinf`/`cenc` and cannot
* serve those, so it yields the element for the session's duration (an observed `loadingSuspended` is
* `preconditions-unmet` there) and this behavior negotiates a second time, for `skd`, in the gap it leaves.
*
* The handoff is needed regardless of any browser bug: it is the init-data type, not a workaround, that the MSE
* negotiation cannot satisfy.
*
* Negotiation is driven by the receiver's first request rather than by the session starting. A session on a FairPlay
* source does not by itself mean the receiver needs anything from this CDM, and the shipped native path
* (`adapters/native-hls-video/src/drm.ts`) resolves its key system the same lazy way. Every request awaits the one
* negotiation, so the certificate is always applied before any `generateRequest` — the same ordering `setupMediaKeys`
* carries across its publish, here carried by the promise.
*
* Deliberately **not** a writer of `context.mediaKeys`. That slot is `setupMediaKeys`' handoff to `exchangeLicenses`,
* and publishing receiver MediaKeys into it would wake `exchangeLicenses` to license an MSE pipeline that is not
* playing. These MediaKeys stay behavior-local, and a cleared `context.mediaKeys` is instead read as the gate proving
* `setupMediaKeys` has finished yielding.
*
* Nothing here dedupes. `listenForEncryptedInitData`'s byte-identity skip is right for MSE, where demuxed audio and
* video fire for the same key, and wrong here: the receiver proxies its own SPC on connect and again on disconnect, so
* a repeat is a second genuine request and dropping it strands the session.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor like `exchangeLicenses`, with one `AbortController` per entry — the state-exit cleanup
* is the abort, which closes every session, plus a detach of the MediaKeys this behavior attached. The detach is
* conditional: both this behavior and `setupMediaKeys` react to the same falling edge, so it releases the element only
* while it still holds it, exactly as the native path does.
*
* **Compose it ahead of `setupMediaKeys`**, beside `exchangeLicenses` and for the same reason: `createComposition`
* calls cleanups in registration order, so the receiver MediaKeys detach before the re-entering negotiation attaches
* its own.
*
* **EME first, then the legacy key system.** Measured on macOS/Safari 26.6.2 against a real receiver: the CDM grants
* access for `initDataTypes: ['skd']` and then throws `NotSupportedError` from `generateRequest` — self-inconsistent,
* and the reason the pre-EME `WebKitMediaKeys` path still exists. That refusal, and only that refusal while the target
* is wireless, hands the session over to `media/dom/fairplay-legacy.ts`; nothing sniffs an OS, so a fixed WebKit stops
* taking the path by itself. The handover then reloads the resource, as the shipped native path does.
*
* Serving the `webkitneedkey` payload already in hand was tried instead, to avoid the reload — `setupAirPlay` holds the
* MediaSource rebuild precisely because a `load()` under a live receiver can destroy a session still being established.
* Measured on macOS/Safari 26.6.2 against a receiver, the legacy CDM refused that session outright:
* `MEDIA_KEYERR_UNKNOWN`, no OSStatus, no license ever requested. Releasing EME's keys is evidently not enough to leave
* the element servable by the old API, so the load algorithm has to run again and the payload from before it is not
* reused. Resource selection re-runs over the `<source>` children, where the native-HLS fallback still sits, so the
* receiver keeps its stream; playback restarts, which the handoff already was.
*
* Droppable. A composition omitting it carries neither `fairPlayAirPlayKeySystem` nor this file nor the legacy module,
* and — since `loadingSuspended` is observed rather than declared — an engine without `setupAirPlay` never leaves
* `'preconditions-unmet'` anyway.

/**
* **Negotiate a key system and attach its MediaKeys for the current source.** Once an encrypted rendition has resolved
* against a media element, negotiate one composed key system over the configured license servers, apply its server
* certificate when it configures one, and attach the resulting MediaKeys — so licensing can begin. Encrypted segment
* loads are gated until the attach lands, and the outcome is published for pruning and licensing to react to: the
* chosen system, or {@link NO_KEY_SYSTEM} for a refusal.
*
* Licensing is `exchangeLicenses`' job, not this behavior's. The handoff is `context.mediaKeys` +
* `state.negotiatedKeySystem`, both published only once the certificate has been applied and the attach has resolved —
* which is what carries the "certificate before `generateRequest`" ordering across the boundary.
*
* The negotiation is the minimal key-system probe — capability-probing's full async probe supersedes it when that lands
* — over per-system init-data types and the declared encryption scheme. The `segmentLoadingBlocked` load gate is raised
* synchronously on entry and lowered once MediaKeys attach: appending encrypted data with no MediaKeys attached
* misbehaves on Chromium, so the segment-load dispatchers park while the gate is up (see `load-segments.ts`); compose
* this behavior ahead of them so the gate is up before their first dispatch — but lowered on _attach_, not on license:
* the appends that follow are what fire `encrypted` for the event-driven path, and browsers queue decode on missing
* keys. Failures report onto the errors sequence via `emitError` (SVTA 4008 no usable key system, 99408 the source is
* non-DRM clear-key encryption we can't decrypt, 4010 MediaKeys init, 4013 certificate); a refused negotiation or
* failed certificate leaves the gate up — playback stays parked rather than failing decode, and severity is the
* adapter's call. A refusal publishes {@link NO_KEY_SYSTEM}, which is what lets rendition pruning reach the verdict
* `track-switching` owns.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor riding the resolver's resolved/unresolved lifecycle, like `setupMediaSource`. The EME
* pipeline runs as one `Task` under a runner the reactor owns — the same shape as `setupTrackResolution` — so source
* replacement routes through `'preconditions-unmet'`, whose state-exit cleanup aborts the task structurally, clears the
* slots, and detaches MediaKeys (`setMediaKeys(null)`) before the next source's setup runs. Teardown-per-source is
* deliberate — MediaKeys re-use across sources is an optimization with prior art (see drm-support.md).
*
* A live AirPlay session routes through that same exit. Playback moves off MSE onto the native-HLS fallback `<source>`
* the receiver plays, and the MediaKeys negotiated here cannot serve the `skd` requests it raises — so an observed
* `loadingSuspended` yields the element, and `setupAirPlayFairPlay` negotiates for the receiver in the gap. The falling
* edge re-enters and re-negotiates with no extra machinery.
*
* Sole writer of `context.mediaKeys`, `state.negotiatedKeySystem`, and `state.segmentLoadingBlocked`. Composed into
* `createHlsVideoEngine` unconditionally today, degenerate on a clear source (the derived state never leaves
* `'preconditions-unmet'`). A composition that omits it — along with `exchangeLicenses` and the two DRM-aware config
* defaults — carries neither the machinery nor the slots, and none of this file's key-system code survives
* tree-shaking; the DRM-free engine variant that would do so is tracked in drm-support.md.
*
* Still out of scope (tracked in drm-support.md): mid-stream key rotation on live Widevine / PlayReady reloads (VOD
* rotation and FairPlay rotation are covered — see `exchangeLicenses`), and `keystatuschange` reactivity.

* **Own the text-track slots on the host media element, mirroring the SPF model.** When a presentation is resolved and

* `<track>` children, since that's the only spec mechanism for adding _and_ removing entries to `textTracks` (no
* `removeTextTrack` API exists). Once slots are provisioned, mirror the resolved `selectedTextTrackId` into their
* `mode`s (one-way: state → DOM), and propagate user-initiated DOM `change` events back to `userTextTrackSelection` —
* the standing _intent_ (a language-based partial, or `'off'`) that `switchTextTrack` resolves into
* `selectedTextTrackId`. So non-SPF consumers (host-page captions buttons, browser native UI, video.js store) drive
* selection by expressing intent, not by writing the resolved id.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'sync-active'`): an element-bound effect allocates the
* slots, applies the initial selection, attaches the `change` listener, and opens a brief Chromium settling-window
* guard, with paired cleanup on element replacement or state exit. A separate effect mirrors subsequent
* `selectedTextTrackId` changes into `mode`s without reallocating the slots.
*
* State-exit cleanup also sends a `'clear'` message to the `TextTracksActor` so its cue+segment cache (keyed by
* trackId) is dropped alongside the DOM `<track>` slots. The actor itself is owned by `setupTextTrackActors` and bound
* to mediaElement, not presentation, so it survives source resets; clearing its context here keeps the cache consistent
* with the DOM. Without this, a subsequent presentation reusing a trackId would have `getSegmentsToLoad` treat its
* segments as already-buffered and skip loading them.
*
* Single-writer separation: `selectedTextTrackId` is the resolved _output_ owned solely by `switchTextTrack`; this
* behavior only reads it (to mirror modes). The write path here is `userTextTrackSelection` — the user-intent _input_ —
* so DOM action and the resolver never contend for one slot. The intent isn't cleared on source unload (it's a standing
* preference, like `userAudioTrackSelection`); `'off'` is written when the user disables all tracks via native UI.
*
* Echo guard: `selectedTextTrackId` is exactly the id this behavior last drove into the DOM, so a `change` event still
* showing it is our own echo (or a resolver-driven correction — e.g. the picked track's CDN failed and the resolver
* disabled it) and is ignored, never written back as a spurious user action. Only a showing id that _differs_ from the
* resolved id is a real user pick. The settling-window guard additionally swallows Chromium's init-time auto-selection
* before the resolved selection has settled.

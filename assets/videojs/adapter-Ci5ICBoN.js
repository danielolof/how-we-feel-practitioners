* Create an audio-only HLS playback engine.
*
* Subtractive composition variant of `createHlsVideoEngine`: omits video-side behaviors (`resolveVideoTrack`,
* `switchVideoTrack`, `setupVideoBufferActors`, `loadVideoSegments`) and subtitle behaviors (`switchTextTrack`,
* `resolveTextTrack`, `syncTextTracks`, `setupTextTrackActors`, `loadTextTrackSegments`). Chapters (`loadChapters`)
* stay: they are session data, not a subtitle rendition. The remaining audio pipeline composes unchanged.
*
* Handles both truly audio-only HLS sources (no video stream-inf) and mixed-AV HLS sources where the audio rendition is
* selected and video / subtitle renditions are ignored at composition time. The variant decision is encoded by adapter
* choice; this engine does not branch on source shape.
*
* @example
*   ```ts
*   let signals: HlsAudioEngineSignals;
*   const engine = createHlsAudioEngine({
*     preferredAudioLanguage: 'en',
*     onSignalsReady: (refs) => {
*       signals = refs;
*     },
*   });
*
*   signals.context.mediaElement.set(audioEl);

* The Mux Media over the SPF HLS engine.
*
* Mirrors `@videojs/mux-video`'s hls.js-backed `MuxVideoAdapter` — same class shape, same `src`/`source` relationship,
* same derived `contentData` — over a different engine, though named for the flavor rather than sharing that class's
* name. It carries no `engine` or `preferPlayback`: SPF publishes no engine-shaped config for a consumer to pass, so
* the source is Mux identity and nothing else.
*
* `source.drm` licenses playback: a `drm.token` derives Mux's three license servers, and entries naming servers
* outright override them. A source carrying neither prunes its encrypted renditions and reports unsupported DRM,
* exactly as an engine with no EME does.

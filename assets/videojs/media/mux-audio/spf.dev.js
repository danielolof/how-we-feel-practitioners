/**
* The Mux Media over the SPF audio-only HLS engine.
*
* Same Mux surface as the video flavor — `src`, the structured `source`, and the derived `contentData` all come from
* the shared mixin — over the subtractive engine, so only the audio renditions of whatever the playback ID names are
* fetched. That is the one place this diverges from the hls.js-backed `<mux-audio>`, which runs the full engine and
* downloads video renditions it never shows.
*
* `source.drm` is accepted but inert, unlike on the video flavor: the audio-only engine composes no EME. Mux encrypts
* video renditions and leaves audio clear, so a protected playback ID still plays here.
*
* `contentData` is kept rather than dropped, for the same reason its hls.js counterpart has it: a playback ID played as
* audio is usually a _video_ asset, whose poster and storyboard exist and which an audio skin may well want. The
* element ignores it either way. Mux publishes neither for a genuinely audio-only asset, so those URLs 404 — see the
* known shortcoming on the video flavor, which shares the derivation.
